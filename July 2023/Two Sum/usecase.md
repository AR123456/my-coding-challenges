The code provided, which finds the indices of two numbers in an array that add up to a target sum, can be useful in various scenarios. One common use case is solving the "Two Sum" problem, which is a classic algorithmic interview question. However, beyond that, it can be applied in practical situations as well. Here's one possible use case:

**Finding Pairs with a Specific Sum in an Array**

Imagine you have an array of integers representing prices of products in an online store, and you want to find all pairs of products whose prices add up to a specific budget that a customer has. You can use the `twoSum` function to efficiently find those pairs without having to compare each price with all other prices in the array.

For example:

```javascript
const productPrices = [100, 50, 120, 80, 200, 30];
const customerBudget = 150;
const pairs = [];

for (let i = 0; i < productPrices.length; i++) {
  const targetSum = customerBudget - productPrices[i];
  const result = twoSum(productPrices, targetSum);

  if (result) {
    pairs.push([productPrices[i], targetSum]);
  }
}

console.log(pairs); // Output: [[100, 50], [120, 30]]
```

In this scenario, the `twoSum` function helps efficiently identify all the pairs of products whose prices add up to the customer's budget (150 in this case). The output will show the pairs of prices that meet this condition.

This use case can be particularly helpful in e-commerce applications where you need to present customers with possible combinations of products within their budget constraints. It saves unnecessary computations and provides an optimal solution for finding pairs with a specific sum in an array.
