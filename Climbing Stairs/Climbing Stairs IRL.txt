Yes, there are real-life use cases for solving the "climbing stairs" problem. While it may seem like a simple exercise, it's actually a fundamental problem in combinatorics and dynamic programming. Here are a few real-world scenarios where a similar approach can be applied:

1. **Fibonacci Sequences**: The "climbing stairs" problem is closely related to the Fibonacci sequence. It can be used as a building block for solving problems involving Fibonacci numbers.

2. **Pathfinding Algorithms**: In certain scenarios, you might have a grid or a graph where you can move in certain directions (e.g., up, down, left, right) with specific step sizes. The number of ways to reach a certain point on the grid can be calculated using a similar dynamic programming approach.

3. **Stock Market Analysis**: In finance, similar approaches can be used to analyze the number of ways a stock price can change over a certain period of time.

4. **Resource Allocation**: In operations research or resource management, you might have a limited set of resources that can be allocated to different tasks. The number of ways to allocate these resources can be calculated using dynamic programming.

5. **Combinatorial Optimization**: In various fields like logistics, manufacturing, and scheduling, dynamic programming can be used to find optimal solutions to problems involving combinations of choices.

6. **Game Theory**: In games and puzzles, dynamic programming can be used to calculate the number of possible game states or moves.

Remember that while the "climbing stairs" problem may appear simple, it serves as a foundation for more complex problems in these and other fields. The ability to break down a problem into smaller subproblems and use dynamic programming techniques is a valuable skill in computer science and mathematics.
