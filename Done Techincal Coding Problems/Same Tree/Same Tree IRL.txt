Binary trees have many applications in computer science and software engineering. Here are some examples:

- **Binary search trees**: Used in many search applications where data is constantly entering/leaving, such as the map and set objects in many languages' libraries ¹.
- **Binary space partition**: Used in almost every 3D video game to determine what objects need to be rendered ¹.
- **Binary tries**: Used in almost every high-bandwidth router for storing router-tables ¹.
- **Hash trees**: Used in torrents and specialized image-signatures in which a hash needs to be verified, but the whole file is not available. Also used in blockchains for example, Bitcoin ¹.
- **Heaps**: Used in implementing efficient priority-queues, which in turn are used for scheduling processes in many operating systems, Quality-of-Service in routers, and A* (path-finding algorithm used in AI applications, including robotics and video games). Also used in heap-sort ¹.
- **Huffman coding tree**: Used in compression algorithms, such as those used by the .jpeg and .mp3 file-formats ¹.
- **Syntax tree**: Constructed by compilers and (implicitly) calculators to parse expressions ¹.

These are just a few examples of how binary trees can be used. Binary trees are a fundamental data structure that can be applied to many different problems.

I hope this helps!
