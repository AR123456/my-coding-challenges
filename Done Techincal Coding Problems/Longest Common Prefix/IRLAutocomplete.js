/* Certainly! Let's consider an example of an autocomplete feature in a search engine or text input field.

**Example: Autocomplete in a Search Engine**

Imagine you're building a search engine like Google. As users start typing their search query, you want to provide real-time autocomplete suggestions to help them find what they're looking for more quickly. Let's say a user starts typing "comp" in the search bar. Your system needs to generate autocomplete suggestions based on the strings in your database.

Suppose you have the following list of strings in your database:

1. "computer science"
2. "company"
3. "comparison"
4. "compile"
5. "complementary"

To provide autocomplete suggestions, you can use the longest common prefix approach. In this case, "comp" is the longest common prefix among all the strings. Therefore, your autocomplete suggestion would be "comp". As the user continues typing, such as "compa," your system can refine the suggestions further based on the new longest common prefix.

Here's how the autocomplete suggestions might look as the user types:

- User types "comp" → Autocomplete suggestion: "comp"
- User types "compa" → Autocomplete suggestion: "company", "comparison", "compile"
- User types "compar" → Autocomplete suggestion: "comparison"
- User types "comput" → Autocomplete suggestion: "computer science"

By using the longest common prefix, you can efficiently provide relevant autocomplete suggestions as users type, enhancing the search experience and helping users find what they're looking for more easily.

In this example, the longest common prefix approach helps in generating relevant suggestions quickly and accurately based on the shared prefixes among potential search queries. */

// Predefined list of strings
const database = [
  "computer science",
  "company",
  "comparison",
  "compile",
  "complementary",
];

// Function to generate autocomplete suggestions
function generateAutocompleteSuggestions(input) {
  const suggestions = [];

  for (const string of database) {
    if (string.startsWith(input)) {
      suggestions.push(string);
    }
  }

  return suggestions;
}

// Simulate user input
const userInput = "compa";
/*  */
// Generate and display autocomplete suggestions
const autocompleteSuggestions = generateAutocompleteSuggestions(userInput);
console.log("Autocomplete suggestions:", autocompleteSuggestions);
/* In this example, the generateAutocompleteSuggestions function iterates through the database array and checks if each string starts with the user's input. If a string starts with the input, it's added to the list of suggestions. Finally, the generated suggestions are displayed in the console.

When you run the code with the simulated user input "compa", you might get output similar to: */
