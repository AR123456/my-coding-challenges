Yes, there are real-life use cases for a function like `checkIfInstanceOf`. Here are a few scenarios where such a function could be useful:

1. **Type Checking in Libraries or Frameworks**: Libraries or frameworks might need to perform type checks to ensure that the provided objects are of the expected type. For example, a UI library might expect a certain type of object to be passed as a prop, and it could use `checkIfInstanceOf` to verify that.

2. **Custom Validation Logic**: In applications where custom validation logic is needed, especially in cases where inheritance and class hierarchies are involved, `checkIfInstanceOf` can be used to determine if an object adheres to specific validation requirements.

3. **Plugin Systems**: In systems with plugin architectures, plugins might need to be validated against specific interfaces or base classes. This function could be used to check if a provided plugin conforms to the expected interface.

4. **Handling Different Data Types in a Generic Way**: In cases where you want to write generic code that can handle different data types, you might want to check if an object is of a certain type before performing operations on it.

5. **Object Initialization Logic**: In cases where you have a factory function responsible for creating objects of different types, you might want to ensure that the created objects are of the expected types.

6. **Polymorphism and Inheritance**: When working with polymorphic code, you might need to ensure that an object can be treated as an instance of a specific base class or interface.

While these are some examples, it's important to note that such type-checking operations should be used sparingly. JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, and it's generally more flexible and idiomatic to rely on "duck typing" (i.e., checking if an object has the required methods or properties) rather than explicitly checking types. Nonetheless, there are situations where explicit type checking can be valuable.
