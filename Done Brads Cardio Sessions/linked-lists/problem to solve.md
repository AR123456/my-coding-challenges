Given 2 non-empty linked list representing two non negative integers The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list. Assume the two numbers to not contain any leading zeros except the number 0 itself.
_ A linked list is a linear data structure similar to an array. However, unlike arrays, elements are not stored in a particular memory location or index. Rather each element is a separate object that contains a pointer or a link to the next object in that list. _

Example :
input (2 -> 4-> 3)+(5-> 6 -> 4)
output 7-> 0 -> 8
explanation 342 + 465 = 807
